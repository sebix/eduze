h1. eduze

eduze is a simple but feature-rich Blogging-System based on KohanaPHP3. But note: it's still under developemet!


h2. Configuration

h3. Database

# Edit @/application/config/database.example.php@ and rename it to database.php
# Get the SQL-Dump from the "Download-Section":http://github.com/sebix/eduze/downloads and import it to your Database

h3. Permissions

bc. mkdir application/cache
chmod 757 application/cache/
mkdir application/logs
chmod 757 application/logs/

It is recommended tor run eduze on an own (sub)domain

h3. Rewriting

h4. Apache

You can find an example configuration in the root-directory of eduze

bc. mv example.htaccess .htaccess

h4. Lighttpd

Example Config with Conditionals

bc. $HTTP["host"] =~ "(^|\.)eduze$" {
        url.rewrite-once = ( 
                "^/img/(.*)$" => "/img/$1",
                "^/piwik/(.*)$" => "/piwik/$1",
                "^/javascripts/(.*)$" => "/javascripts/$1",
                "^/stylesheets/(.*)$" => "/stylesheets/$1",
                "^/favicon.ico" => "/favicon.ico",
                "^/(.*)$" => "/index.php/$1"
        )   
}

This works also with Virtual-Hosts!
